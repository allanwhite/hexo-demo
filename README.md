# Hexo CMS Demo

## Installation

[Installing Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) is quite easy. However, you do need to have a couple of other things installed first:

* Node.js
* Git

If your computer already has these, congratulations! Just install Hexo with npm:

`$ npm install -g hexo-cli`

## Setup

Once Hexo is installed, run the following commands to initialize Hexo in the target `<folder>`.

```
$ hexo init <folder>
$ cd <folder>
$ npm install
```
Once initialized, here’s what your project folder will look like:

```
├── _config.yml
├── package.json
├── scaffolds
├── source
|   ├── _drafts
|   └── _posts
└── themes
```

See the Hexo [commands](https://hexo.io/docs/commands.html) for info on running the site build tasks.
